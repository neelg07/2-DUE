# 2-DUE
Personalized To-Do List Web Application

### Why? 
I am creating this to submit as my final project for Harvard's CS50x online course. In addition to material learned in the course, I will also be using the Web Development skills I honed in the past few weeks through 'The Odin Project' to create a well-developed web application with no guidance or "rules" to follow. This will essentially be a big test on my abilities and personal development as a programmer. 

### What is 2-DUE?
As stated before, 2-DUE is a web application designed to act like a To-Do list. Research shows that time-boxing and planning out a schedule for your day improves the likelihood of one actually following through and committing to said goals. 

Consistency and repetitive action tend to turn into strong habits over time. Realizing and leveraging this phenomenon can yield large-scale results over a long enough time. As a programmer taking the self-taught route, I try to maximize my probability of achieving goals using this same process and figured it would be a great idea for a project that will test and develop certain skills needed by a developer.

Since a To-Do list is sort of played out as a self-project in the typical developer's portfolio, I will be attempting to add certain personalized features in 2-DUE to make it better than your average To-Do list. Some features in mind are a built in weather app, clock, timer/stop-watch, and random quotes of the day, on top of the To-Do list.  

### Software
I will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask.
